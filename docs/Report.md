##  Project Overview

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphone sensor data has become essential in healthcare monitoring, fitness tracking, workplace safety, and smart human-computer interaction. Traditional models rely on fully labeled datasets; however, acquiring labeled data at scale is costly and time-consuming. This project demonstrates a **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)** approach to HAR using the UCI HAR dataset. The key idea is to leverage a small fraction of labeled data (~5%) and a large amount of unlabeled data through pseudo-labeling techniques to build effective activity classifiers.

##  Technical Workflow

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Parsed `features.txt`, `activity_labels.txt`, and training/testing data.
- Ensured all 561 feature names were made unique to avoid column duplication.
- Mapped activity IDs to meaningful labels for interpretability.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Inspected class and subject distributions.  
- Generated boxplots, histograms, correlation heatmaps, and pairwise scatter plots.  
- Used PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and to assess the natural separability of activity clusters.

![PCA](images/Screenshot_EDA_PCA.png)  
![t-SNE](images/Screenshot_EDA_TSNE.png)  

### 3. **Preprocessing**
- Standardized the features using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features contribute equally.
- Created a labeled/unlabeled mask by randomly keeping only 5% of training labels and setting the rest as `-1`.

### 4. **Baseline Supervised Learning**
- Trained a `RandomForestClassifier` using only the labeled subset (5%).
- Evaluated test accuracy and confusion matrix.

### 5. **Pseudo-Labeling (Self-Training)**
- Predicted class probabilities for unlabeled data.
- Selected only those with high-confidence predictions (threshold ≥ 0.95).
- Added pseudo-labeled samples back to the training set.

### 6. **Final Training (SSL Enhanced Model)**
- Trained an expanded model using both original and pseudo-labeled data.
- Evaluated improved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Compared performance of `RandomForestClassifier` and `LogisticRegression`.

##  Evaluation Summary

| Model | Accuracy (Labeled Only) | Accuracy (After Pseudo-Labeling) |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Random Forest | 0.869 | 0.861 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.896 | 0.895 |
| Final Pipeline (SSL) | — | **0.906**  |

##  Streamlit App (Deployed Locally)

A lightweight Streamlit web app was created to demonstrate the end-to-end classification. The user can:
- Upload sensor feature data as `.csv`
- View predicted activity for each sample
- Display model metrics and confidence

##  Why Semi-Supervised Learning?

Semi-supervised learning helps bridge the gap between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. In real-world HAR scenarios:
- Manual labeling is costly and labor-intensive.
- Unlabeled sensor data is easy to collect (smartphones, wearables).
- SSL enables rapid model development with reduced labeling effort.

This project demonstrates that **self-training with high-confidence pseudo-labeling** can achieve near-supervised accuracy with just 5% of labeled data — highlighting SSL's real-world applicability.
